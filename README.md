# FTP Deploy Action

## with Server-Side Hash Diffing

[![GitHub Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/badge/Marketplace-FTP%20Hash%20Deploy-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ftp-hash-deploy)

> Deploy only changed files via FTP/FTPS — using server-side **Git-style hashing**.

No state files. No timestamp guesswork. The server tells you what it has. You upload only what changed.

## How it works

1. Uploads `hashme.php` to the server via FTPS
2. Fetches the server's file hashes via HTTP — computed as **Git blob hashes** (`SHA1(blob {len}\0{content})`)
3. Deletes `hashme.php`
4. Computes the same hashes locally
5. Uploads only files where hashes differ — deletes files no longer present locally

The hash algorithm is identical to Git's own object hashing. If a file has the same Git blob hash on server and locally, it is bit-for-bit identical and won't be re-uploaded.

## No state file, ever

There's nothing to lose, corrupt, or let go stale — every deploy asks the server directly what it already has, via the same hash Git uses for its own objects. Delete everything, rerun on a fresh CI runner, doesn't matter: the result is always correct, because the server's own files are the only source of truth.

## FTP Deploy Action — State-File-Based Tools vs. Agundur's Hash-Based Approach

Most FTP deploy actions (like the widely-used [SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action](https://github.com/SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action)) track what's been uploaded in a state file (`.ftp-deploy-sync-state.json` by default). That works well — until the state file gets deleted, or someone edits a file directly on the server. Then the state file and reality drift apart, and the next deploy either re-uploads everything or misses a change.

This action skips the state file entirely: every deploy asks the server directly, via the same Git blob hash Git itself uses. Delete the state, change a file by hand, run on a brand-new CI runner — the result is always correct, because there's nothing to go stale.

**Trade-off:** this requires your server to support PHP (a tiny script is uploaded, used once, then deleted). If your host can't run PHP — a Node/static host, for example — SamKirkland's action is a solid, battle-tested choice instead.

## Usage

```yaml
- name: Deploy
  uses: Agundur-KDE/ftp-hash-deploy-action@v1
  with:
    ftp-host:     ${{ secrets.FTP_HOST }}
    ftp-user:     ${{ secrets.FTP_USER }}
    ftp-password: ${{ secrets.FTP_PASSWORD }}
    site-url:     https://example.com
    local-dir:    ./dist/
    server-dir:   /public_html/
```

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ftp-host` | ✓ | — | FTP server hostname |
| `ftp-user` | ✓ | — | FTP username |
| `ftp-password` | ✓ | — | FTP password |
| `site-url` | ✓ | — | Public URL (for fetching hashes via `hashme.php`) |
| `ftp-port` | | `21` | FTP port |
| `ftps` | | `true` | Use FTPS explicit TLS |
| `local-dir` | | `./` | Local directory to deploy |
| `server-dir` | | `/` | **Web root on the FTP server** — the path where your site files live |
| `dry-run` | | `false` | Show diff without uploading |

### Finding your `server-dir`

The FTP account root (`/`) is usually not the web root. Set `server-dir` to wherever your site files live:

| Host type | Typical `server-dir` |
|---|---|
| All-Inkl, Strato, Ionos | `/web/` |
| cPanel hosts | `/public_html/` |
| Plesk hosts | `/httpdocs/` |
| Custom / root-level | `/` |

When in doubt: log in via FTP and look for the directory that contains your `index.html`.

## Troubleshooting

**Connection timeout / connection refused / "control socket" errors**

- Uses **passive FTP mode by default** (Python's `ftplib` default) — this already avoids most firewall issues, since it doesn't require the server to open an inbound connection back to the runner.
- The connection timeout is currently fixed at 30 seconds, not user-configurable.
- If your host requires **implicit** FTPS (typically port 990) instead of **explicit** FTPS (port 21, what this action uses), the connection will fail — check with your host which one they expect.
- If your host doesn't support FTPS at all, set `ftps: false` to fall back to plain FTP.
- **IP allowlisting**: GitHub-hosted runners use a large, changing range of IP addresses. If your FTP server restricts access to specific IPs, deploys from GitHub Actions will be blocked regardless of correct credentials — you'll need a self-hosted runner or to open the firewall for GitHub's published IP ranges.

**Before debugging further:** run with `dry-run: true` first. It connects, authenticates, and computes the full diff without transferring anything — most config problems (wrong port, wrong `server-dir`, bad credentials) show up here without any risk to your live site.

## Requirements

- Server must run **PHP** (for `hashme.php`)
- FTP or FTPS access
- Public HTTP access to the site URL during deploy
